<p class="drop-capi">HAuing of late, vpon
mature deliberation,
with the aduice and vniforme
consent of Our
whole Priuie Councell,
determined to dissolue
the Assembly and Conuention
of Parliament, lately called together
by Our Regall power and Authoritie,
Wee were pleased by Our Proclamation,
giuen at Our Palace of <i>Westminster</i> the
sixt day of this instant <i>Ianuary</i>, to declare,
not onely Our pleasure and resolution<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
therein, but also to expresse some especiall
passages and proceedings, moouing vs to
that resolution: Wherein, albeit hauing so
many yeeres swayed the swords and scepters
of three renowned kingdomes, Wee
cannot but discerne (as much as any Prince
liuing) what apperteineth to the height of
a powerfull Monarch: yet, that all men
might discerne, that Wee, like Gods true
Viceregent, delight not so much in the
greatnesse of Our place, as in the goodnesse
&amp; benignitie of our gouernment, We were
content in that one Act to descend many
degrees beneath Our Selfe: First, by communicating
to all Our people the reasons of
a resolution of State, which Princes vse to
reserue, <i>inter arcana Imperij</i>, to themselues
and their Priuie Councell: Secondly, by
mollifying and mixing the peremptorie
and binding qualitie of a Proclamation,
with the indulgence of a milde and fatherly
instruction: And lastly, leading them,
and opening to them that forbidden Arke
of Our absolute and indisputable Prerogatiue,
concerning the calling, continuing,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
and dissoluing of Parliaments: which,
though it were more then superabundant
to make Our Subiects know the realitie of
Our sincere intentions; yet Wee not satisfied
therewith, but finding the bounds of
a Proclamation too straight to conteine
and expresse the boundlesse affection that
Wee beare to Our good and louing people,
are pleased hereby to inlarge Our Selfe,
(as Wee promised in Our said Proclamation)
by a more full and plaine expression of
those Letters and Messages that passed
from Vs to the Commons in Parliament,
which by reason of the length of them,
could not bee related at large, but briefly
pointed at in Our said Proclamation. For,
as in generall the great actions of Kings
are done as vpon a stage, obuious to the
publike gazing of euery man; so are Wee
most willing, that the trueth of this particular,
concerning Our owne honour, and
the satisfaction of Our Subjects, should bee
represented vnto all men without vaile or
couering, being assured that the most plainnesse
and freedome will most aduantage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
Vs, hauing in this, and all Our Actions euer
affected such sinceritie and vprightnes
of heart, as were Wee all transparent, and
that men might readily passe to Our inward
thoughts, they should there perceiue
the selfe-same affections which Wee haue
euer professed in Our outward words
and Actions.</p>

<p>Hauing anticipated the time of reassembling
Our Parliament to the twentieth day
of <i>Nouember</i> last, (which Wee formerly appointed
to haue met vpon the eighth of
<i>February</i> next,) vpon the confidence that
their noble and generous declaration at
their parting the fourth of <i>Iune</i> put vs in,
of their free and liberall assistance to the
recouery of Our Childrens ancient inheritance,
and hauing declared to them Our
resolution of taking vpon Vs the defence
of Our childrens patrimonie by way of
Armes, the Commons very heartily and
dutifully fell immediatly after their reassembling,
to treat of a necessary supplie,
and concluded, for the present, to grant a
Subsidie to be paid in <i>February</i> next, (the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
last paiment of the latter Subsidie granted
by them being not to come in vntill <i>May</i>
following) whereby Wee were well and
cleerly satisfied of the good intenti[=o] of the
Commons in generall, by whose vniforme
vote &amp; assent that Subsidy was resolued on,
not without intimation of a more ample
supplie to be yeelded in conuenient time.</p>

<p class="b4">But before this their resolution was reduced
into a formall Acte or Bill, some
discontented persons that were the cause
of all that euill which succeeded, endeauouring
to clog the good will of the Commons
with their owne vnreasonable ends,
fell to dispute in the House of Our high
Prerogatiues, namely of the match of Our
dearest sonne the Prince, of the making
warre with forreigne Princes Our Allies,
betweene whom and Vs there was a firme
peace religiously made and obserued hitherunto:
All which they couered with
the cloake of Religion, and with the faire
pretence of a duetifull Petition to bee preferred
to Vs. Wee vnderstanding right
well, that those points were not disputable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
in Parliament, without Our owne Royall
direction, being of Our highest Prerogatiues,
the very Characters of Souereignty; &amp;
thinking, that when euery Subiect by nature,
and the Lawes of the Realme, had the
power of matching their children according
to their owne best liking, none should
denie Vs the like; especially Wee hauing at
the beginning of the Parliament declared
Our purpose concerning the matching of
Our Sonne, the Prince, were fully perswaded,
that those specious outsides of Religion
and humble petitioning, were added
onely to gaine passage vnto those things,
which being propounded in their true
colours, must needs haue appeared vniust
and vnreasonable, as matters wherewith
neuer any Parliament had presumed to
meddle before, except they had bene thereunto
required by their King; nay, not befitting
Our Priuie Councell to meddle
with, without Our speciall command and
allowance; since the very consulting vpon
such matters (though in neuer so priuate
a maner) being discouered abroad, might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
at some time produce as ill effects, as if they
were publikely resolued vpon. For as concerning
the point of Religion, We aswell in
the beginning of the Parliament, by a publike
and open Declaration made to both
Houses in the higher House of Parliament,
as also shortly after, by a gracious answere
vnto a former Petition of theirs, expressed
to the full Our immutable resolution to
maintaine true Religion, besides the vntainted
practise of Our whole life in that
point. And howsoeuer an humble Petition
beare a faire shew of respect; yet if
vnder colour of concluding on a Petition,
a way should bee opened to treat in Parliament
of the mysteries of State, without
Our Royall allowance, it were a great and
vnusuall breach vpon the Royall power:
Besides, who knoweth not that the preferring
of a Petition, includes an expectation
to haue it graunted? and therefore to nippe
this springing euill in the beginning, Wee
directed Our Letters to the Speaker of that
House, the tenour of which Letters followeth.</p>

<p class="drop-capi2">MAster Speaker, <i>Wee
haue heard by diuers reports
to Our great griefe,
That the farre distance
of Our Person at this time from Our
high Court of Parliament, caused by
Our want of health, hath emboldened
some fiery and popular spirits in Our
House of Commons, to debate and argue
publikely, in matters farre beyond
their reach or capacitie, and so tending
to Our high dishonour, and to the
trenching vpon Our Prerogatiue
Royall. You shall therefore acquaint
that House with Our Pleasure, That
none therein shall henceforth presume
to meddle with any thing concerning
Our gouernment, or mysteries of State;
namely, not to speake of Our dearest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Sonnes match with the Daughter of</i>
Spaine, <i>nor to touch the Honour of
that King, or any other Our friends
or Confederates: And also not to
meddle with any mens particulars,
which haue their due motion in Our
ordinarie Courts of Justice. And
whereas We heare that they haue sent
a message to</i> S<sup>ir</sup> Edwin Sandys, <i>to
know the reasons of his late restraint,
you shall in Our name resolue them,
That it was not for any misdemeanour
of his in Parliament: But to put them
out of doubt of any question of that
nature that may arise among them
hereafter, you shall resolue them in
Our name, That We thinke our Selfe
very free and able to punish any mans
misdemeanours in Parliament, as well
during their sitting, as after; which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
We meane not to spare hereafter, vpon
any occasion of any mans insolent
behauiour there, that shall be ministred
vnto Us. And if they haue already
touched any of these points which
Wee haue here forbidden, in any Petition
of theirs which is to be sent vnto
Vs, it is Our pleasure that you shall
tell them, That except they reforme
it before it come to Our hands, Wee
will not deigne the hearing nor answering
of it. And whereas Wee heare
that they are desirous, that We should
make this a Seßion of Parliament before
Christmas, You may tell them, It
shall be in their default if they want
it: For if they will make ready betweene
this and that time, some such
Lawes as shall be really good for the
Common-wealth, Wee will very willingly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
giue Our Royall assent vnto
them: And so it shall thereby appeare,
That if good Lawes be not made at
this time for the weale of the people,
the blame shall onely and most iustly
lie vpon such turbulent spirits, as shall
preferre their particular ends to the
weale of this Kingdome and Common-wealth.
And so We bid you farewell.

both their names by the right Reuerend
Father in God, the Archbishop
of</i> Canterbury, <i>And likewise for
the good gouernement of</i> Ireland <i>We
are now in hand with at your request.
But not onely haue Wee heard no
newes of all this, but contrary great
complaints of the danger of Religion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
within this Kingdome tacitely
implying Our ill gouernment in this
point. And We leaue to you to iudge,
whether it be your duties that are the
Representatiue body of Our people,
so to distast them with Our gouernment,
whereas by the contrary it is
your duty with all your endeauours to
kindle more and more a dutifull and
thankefull loue in the peoples hearts
towards Vs for Our iust and gracious
gouernment. Now, whereas in
the very beginning of this your Apologie,
you taxe Vs in faire termes
of trusting vncertaine reports, and
partiall informations concerning your
proceedings, We wish you to remember,
that We are an old and experienced
King, needing no such leßons, being
in Our conscience freest of any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
King aliue from hearing or trusting
idle reports, which so many of your
House as are neerest Vs can beare
witnesse vnto you, if you would giue
as good eare to them, as you doe to
some Tribunitiall Orators amongst
you. And for proofe in this particular,
Wee haue made your owne
Meßengers conferre your other Petition,
sent by you with the copie thereof,
which was sent Vs before, betweene
which there is no difference
at all, but that since Our receiuing
the first Copy you added a conclusion
vnto it, which could not come to Our
hands till it was done by you, and your
Meßengers sent, which was all at
one time. And if that We had had
no Copie of it before hand, We must
haue receiued your first Petition to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
Our great dishonour, before Wee had
knowen what it conteined, which
would haue enforced Vs to haue returned
you a farre worse answer
then now We doe. For then your
Meßengers had returned with nothing;
but that Wee haue iudged
your petition vnlawfull and vnworthy
of an Answere. For as to your
Conclusion thereof, it is nothing, but</i>
Protestatio contraria facto. <i>For
in the body of your petition you vsurpe
vpon Our Prerogatiue Royall,
and meddle with things farre aboue
your reach: And then in the conclusion
you protest the contrary, as if a
Robber would take a mans purse,
and then protest he meant not to rob
him. For first, you presume to giue
Vs your aduice concerning the match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
of Our dearest Son with some Protestant,
We cannot say Princeße (for
Wee know none of these fit for him,)
and disswade Vs from his match with</i>
Spaine, <i>vrging Vs to a present
warre with that King: And yet in
the conclusion, forsooth, ye protest ye
intend not to preße vpon Our most
vndoubted and regall Prerogatiue
as if the Petitioning of Vs in matters
that your selues confeße yee ought
not to meddle with, were not a medling
with them. And whereas yee
pretend, that you were inuited to this
course by the speeches of three Honourable
Lords; Yet by so much as
your selues repeat of their speeches,
nothing can bee concluded, but that
Wee were resolued by warre to regaine
the</i> Palatinate, <i>if otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
VVee could not attaine vnto it; and
you were inuited to aduise forthwith
vpon a supplie for keeping the forces
in the</i> Palatinate <i>from disbanding,
and to foresee the meanes for the raysing
and maintaining of the body of
an Armie for that warre against the
Spring. Now what inference can
be made vpon this, That therefore
VVe must presently denounce warre
against the King of</i> Spaine, <i>breake
Our dearest Sonnes match, and
match him to one of Our Religion, let
the world iudge. The difference is
no greater, then as if We would tell
a Merchant, that Wee had great
neede to borrow money from him
for raysing an Armie, that thereupon
it should follow, that VVe were bound
to follow his aduice in the directions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
of the warre, and all things depending
thereupon. But yet not contenting
your selues with this excuse of
yours, which indeed cannot hold water,
ye come after to a direct contradiction
to the conclusion of your former
Petition, saying, That the Honour
and safety of Vs and Our Posterity,
and the</i> Patrimony <i>of Our
Children, inuaded and poßessed by
their enemies, the welfare of Religion,
and State of Our Kingdome are
matter at any time not vnfit for your
deepest considerations in Parliament.
To this generality We answere
with the</i> Logicians, <i>That where all
things are contained, nothing is omitted.
So as this plenipotencie of
yours inuests you in all power vpon
Earth, lacking nothing but the Popes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
to haue the keyes also both of Heauen
and Purgatory. And to this vast
generality of yours, VVe can giue no
other answer, for it will trouble all the
best Lawyers in the House to make
a good Commentary vpon it: For so
did the Puritan Ministers in Scotland
bring all kinde of causes within
the compasse of their iurisdiction,
saying, That it was the Churches office
to iudge of slander, and there
could no kinde of crime or fault bee
committed, but there was a slander
in it, either against God, the King,
or their Neighbour. And by this
meanes they hooked in to themselues
the cognisance of all causes, or like</i>
Bellarmines <i>distinction of the Popes
power ouer all Kings</i>, in ordine ad
Spiritualia, <i>whereby he giues him all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
temporall iurisdiction ouer them. But
to giue you a direct Answer to the
matter of warre, for which you are so
earnest, VVe confeße VVee rather expected
that you should haue giuen Vs
great and hartie thanks for the so
long maintaining a setled peace in all
Our Dominions, when as all Our
Neighbours about are in a miserable
combustion of warre; but</i> Dulce
bellum inexpertis; <i>and We indeed
find by experience, that a number of
Our Subiects are so pampered with
peace, as they are desirous of change,
though they know not what. It is
true that We haue euer professed, and
in that minde, with Gods grace, Wee
meane to liue and die, That We will
labour by all meanes poßible, either by
treaty, or by force to restore Our Children<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
to their ancient Dignities and
Inheritances; and whatsoeuer Christian
Princes or Potentates will set
themselues against it, Wee will not
spare any lawfull meanes to bring Our
so iust and Honourable purpose to a
good end; neither shall the Match
of Our Sonne, or any other worldly respect
be preferred to this Our Resolution:
For by Our credit, and interuention
with the King of Spaine, and
the Arch-dutcheße, and her Husband
now with God, Wee preserued
the lower</i> Palatinat <i>one whole yeere
from any further conquering in it,
which within any eight dayes space in
that time might haue easily been swallowed
vp by</i> Spinolaes <i>Armie, without
any resistance; and in no better case
was it now, at Our Ambassadour, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
Lord</i> Digbies <i>comming through</i>
Heydleberg, <i>if he had not extraordinarily
succoured it. But because
Wee perceiue that ye couple this warre
of the</i> Palatinate <i>with the cause of
Religion, We must a little vnfold your
eyes herein. The beginning of this
miserable warre, which hath set all
Christendome on fire, was not for Religion;
but onely caused by Our Sonne
in law his hastie and rash Resolution,
following euill counsell, to take to himselfe
the Crowne of</i> Bohemia: <i>And
that this is true, himselfe wrote Letters
vnto Vs at that time, desiring
Vs to giue aßurance, both to the
French King, and State of</i> Venice,
<i>that his accepting of the Crowne of</i>
Bohemia <i>had no reference to the
cause of Religion, but onely by reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
of his right by Election (as hee
called it:) And we would be sorrie
that that aspersion should come vpon
Our Religion, as to make it a good
pretext for dethroning of Kings, and
vsurping their Crownes. And Wee
would bee loath that Our people here
should be taught that doctrine: No,
let vs not so farre wrong the Iesuits,
as to rob them of their sweet Positions
and practise in that point. And vpon
the other part, We aßure Our selfe so
farre of your charitable thoughts of
Vs, that Wee would neuer haue constantly
denyed Our Sonne in law, both
the title and aßistance in that point, if
Wee had beene well perswaded of the
iustice of his quarrell. But to conclude
this point, This vniust vsurpation of
the Crownes of</i> Bohemia <i>and</i> Hungaria<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
<i>from the Emperour, hath giuen
the Pope, and all that partie, too faire
a ground, and opened them too wide a
gate for the curbing and oppreßing of
many thousands of Our Religion,
in diuers parts of Christendome.
And whereas yee excuse your
touching vpon the King of</i> Spaine
<i>vpon the occasion of the incidents by
you repeated in that place, and yet affirme
that it is without any touch to
his honor, We cannot wonder ynough,
that ye are so forgetfull, both of your
words and writs. For in your former
Petition ye plainely affirme, that hee
affects the Temporall Monarchie
of the whole earth, then which there
can be no more malice vttered against
any great King, to make all other
Princes and Potentates, both enuie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
and hate him. But, if ye list, it may be
easily tryed, whether that speech touched
him in honour or not, if We shall
aske him the question, whether hee
meanes to aßume to himselfe that
title or no; For euery King can best
iudge of his owne honour. Wee omit
the particular eiaculations of some
foule mouthed Orators in your House,
against the honour of his Crowne and
State. And touching your excuse
of not determining any thing concerning
the Match of Our dearest Sonne,
but onely to tell your opinions, and lay
it downe at Our feet; First, We desire
to know how you could haue presumed
to determine in that point, without
committing of high Treason. And
next, you cannot deny, but your talking
of his Match after that manner was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
a direct breach of Our commandement
&amp; Declaration out of Our own
mouth, at the first sitting downe of this
Parliament; where We plainely professed,
that We were in treatie of his
Match with</i> Spaine, <i>and wished you
to haue that confidence in Our Religion
and Wisedome, that We would
so manage it, as our Religion should
receiue no preiudice by it. And the
same We now repeat vnto you, professing,
that We are so farre ingaged in
that Match, as We cannot in honour
goe backe, except the King of</i> Spaine
<i>performe not such things as We expect
at his hands. And therefore We
are sorrie, that ye should shew to haue
so great distrust in Vs, or to conceiue
that We should be cold in our Religion:
Otherwise We cannot imagine<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
how Our former publike Declaration
should not haue stopped your mouthes
in this point. And as to your request,
that We would now receiue your former
Petition, We wonder what could
make you presume that Wee would
now receiue it; whereas in Our former
Letter We plainely declared the contrarie
vnto you; and therefore Wee
haue iustly reiected that suit of yours:
For what haue you left vnattempted
in the highest points of Soueraigntie in
that Petition of yours, except the
striking of Coine; For it containes the
violation of Leagues, the particular
way how to gouerne a warre, and the
Marriage of Our dearest Sonne, both
negatiue with</i> Spaine, <i>nay with any other
Popish Princesse; and also affirmatiue, as
to the matching with one of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
Our Religion, which Wee confesse is
a straine beyond any prouidence or
wisedome God hath giuen Vs, as
things now stand. These are vnfit
things to be handled in Parliament,
except your King should require it of
you; For who can haue wisedome to
iudge of things of that nature, but such
as are daily acquainted with the particulars
of Treaties, and of the variable
or fixed connexion of affaires of
State, together with the knowledge of
the secret wayes, ends, and intentions
of Princes in their seuerall negotiations;
otherwise a small mistaking in
matters of this nature, may produce
more effects then can be imagined:
And therefore</i>, Ne sutor vltra crepidam.
<i>And besides, the intermedling
in Parliament with matters of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
Peace or Warre, and Marriage of
Our dearest Sonne, would be such a
diminution to Vs and to Our Crowne
in forreine Countreys, as would make
any Prince neglect to treat with Vs,
either in matters of Peace or Marriage,
except they might be assured by
the assent of Parliament. And so it
prooued long agoe with a King of</i>
France, <i>who vpon a tricke procuring
his States to dissent from some treaty,
which before he had made, was after
refused treating with by other Princes,
to his great reproach, vnlesse hee
Would first procure the assent of the
three Estates to their proposition. And
will you cast your eyes vpon the late
times, you shall finde, that the late
Queene of famous memorie was humbly
petitioned by a Parliament to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
pleased to Marrie; But her answere
was, That shee liked their Petition
well, because it was simple, not limiting
her to place or person, as not befitting
her liking to their fancies; and if
they had done otherwise, shee would
haue thought it a high presumption in
them. Iudge then what Wee may doe
in such a case, hauing made Our publique
Declaration alreadie, as VVee
said before, directly contrary to that
which you haue now petitioned.
Now to those points in your Petition,
whereof you desire an answere, as
properly belonging to a Parliament;
The first and greatest point is that of
Religion, concerning which at this
time Wee can giue you no other answere
then in the generall, which is,
That you may rest secure, that Wee<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
will neuer be wearie to doe all Wee
can for the propagation of Our Religion,
and repreßing of Poperie; but
the maner and forme you must remit to
Our care and prouidence, who can
best consider of times and seasons, not
by vndertakng a publique warre of
Religion through all the world at
once, which how hard and dangerous
a taske it would prooue, you may
iudge. But this puts vs in mind, how
all the world complained the last yeere
of plentie of Corne, and God hath
sent vs a cooling card this yeere for
that heat; And so We pray God, that
this desire amongst you of kindling
warres, shewing your wearinesse of
Peace and Plentie, may not make
God permit vs to fall in the miseries
of both. But as Wee alreadie said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
Our care of Religion must be such, as
on the one part We must not by the hote
prosecution of Our Recusants at home
irritate forreine Princes of contrary
Religion, and teach them the way to
plague the Protestants in their Dominions,
whom with Wee daily intercede,
and at this time principally, for
ease to them of Our profeßion that
liue vnder them; yet vpon the other
part, We neuer meane to spare from
due and seuere punishment any Papist
that will grow insolent for liuing vnder
Our so milde Gouernment. And
you may also be assured, We will leaue
no care vntaken, as well for the good
education of the youth at home, especially
the children of Papists, as also
for preseruing at all times hereafter
the youth that are, or shall be abroad,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
from being bred in dangerous places,
and so poisoned in Popish Seminaries.
And as in this point, namely concerning
the good education of the Popish
youth at home, We haue alreadie
giuen some good proofe, both in
this Kingdome and in</i> Ireland: <i>So
will We be well pleased to passe any
good Lawes that shall be made, either
now, or at any time hereafter to this
purpose. And as to your request, of
making this a Seßion, and granting
a generall Pardon, it shall be in your
defaults if Wee make not this a Seßion
before Christmas, as in Our former
Letter We notified vnto you. But
for the Pardon, yee craue such particulars
in it as Wee must be well aduised
vpon, lest otherwise Wee giue
you backe the double or triple of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
Wee are to receiue by your entire
Subsidie without Fifteens. But the
ordinarie course Wee hold fittest to
bee vsed still in this case, which is,
that Wee should of Our free grace
send you downe a Pardon from the
Higher House, containing such points
as We shall thinke fittest, wherein We
hope ye shall receiue good satisfaction.
But We cannot omit to shew you how
strange We thinke it, that ye should
make so bad and vniust a Commentarie
vpon some words of Our former
Letter, as if We meant to restraine
you thereby of your ancient priuiledges
and liberties in Parliament.
Truly a scholler would bee ashamed
so to misplace and misiudge any sentences
in another mans booke. For
whereas in the fore-end of Our former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Letter We discharge you to meddle
with matters of gouernment, or
mysteries of State, namely matters
of Warre or Peace, or Our dearest
Sonnes Match with</i> Spaine; <i>by
which particular denominations We
interpret and restraine Our former
words; and then towards the end of
Our Letter We forbid you to meddle
with such things as haue their ordinarie
course in Courts of Justice: Yee
couple together those two sentences,
lying farre asunder, and plainly leaue
out these words, of mysteries of State;
So as ye erre</i> à bene diuisis ad male
coniuncta. <i>For of the former part,
concerning mysteries of State, Wee
plainelie restrained Our meaning to
the particulars that were after mentioned:
and in the latter We confeße<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
We meant it by</i> S<sup>ir</sup> Edward Cokes
<i>foolish busineße, because these heades
he is accused of were before your
meeting presented vnto Vs, and We
had setled a legall course of proceeding
therein. And therefore it had
well become him, especiallie being
Our Seruant, and one of Our Councell,
if hee had had any thing against
it, to haue complained vnto Vs,
which he neuer did, though he was
ordinarilie at Our Court, since that
time, and neuer had acceße refused
vnto him. And although We cannot
allow of the stile, calling it your ancient
and vndoubted right and inheritance,
but could rather haue wished,
that ye had said that your priuiledges
were deriued from the grace and permißion
of Our Ancestours and Vs;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
For most of them grow from precedents,
which shewes rather a toleration
then inheritance. Yet Wee are
pleased to giue you Our Royall assurance,
That as long as you shall continue
to containe your selues within
the limits of your dutie and respect
to Vs (as Wee aßure Our selfe you
will doe) Wee will bee as carefull to
maintaine and preserue your lawfull
liberties and priuiledges as euer any
Our Predeceßours were, nay as to
preserue Our owne Royall Prerogatiue.
So as your House shall onelie
haue neede to beware to trench vpon
the Prerogatiue of the Crowne,
which would enforce Vs, or any iust
King to retrench them of their priuiledges,
that would pare his Prerogatiue
and flowers of the Crowne.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
But of this We hope there shall neuer
be cause giuen. And to conclude, since
Wee haue now so largely expressed
the sinceritie of Our meaning vnto
you, We require you to goe on cheerefullie,
and to vse all conuenient diligence
for preparing such good Lawes
for Vs to paße at this time, as the
people may see the care, that both
Wee and you haue for the good gouernement
of the Kingdome; ending
as We did in Our former Letter; If
there be not a happie Seßion made at
this time, it shall bee in your default.
And aboue all, beware by your waywardneße
at this time, to giue Our
Childrens Aduersaries cause to insult
vpon them, vpon the rumour that
shall be spred abroad of a distraction
betweene Vs and Our people, wherof<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>

Councellour, Wee
greet you well. Wee
are sorrie to heare, that,
notwithstanding Our reiterated
Meßages to Our House of Commons,
for going on in their businesses
in regard of the shortneße of time,
betwixt this and Christmas, and of
their owne earnest desire, that Wee
should now conclude a Seßion, by making
of good and profitable Lawes,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
they continue to loose time; And now
of late, vpon Our gracious Answer sent
vnto them, haue taken occasion to
make more delay, in appointing a
Committee to morrow, to consider
vpon the points of Our Answer; and
especially concerning that point in it
which maketh mention of their priuiledges.
Our pleasure therefore is,
that you shall in Our name tell them,
that We are so loath to haue time
mis-spent, which is so pretious a thing,
in the well vsing whereof Our people
may receiue so great a benefit, as We
are thus farre contented to discend
from Our Royall dignity, by explaining
at this time Our meaning in Our
sayd Answer, touching that point,
That all Our good Subiects in that
House, that intend nothing but Our
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
Honour, and the weale of the Common-wealth,
may cleerely see Our
intention. Whereas in Our sayd Answere
We told them, that Wee could
not allow of the stile, calling it their
ancient and vndoubted right and inheritance;
but could rather haue
wished, that they had sayd their priuiledges
were deriued from the grace
and permißion of Our Ancestors and
Vs: (for most of them grow from presidents,
which shewes rather a toleration
then inheritance) the plaine truth
is, That Wee cannot with patience
endure Our Subiects to vse such Antimonarchicall
words to Vs concerning
their Liberties, except they had subioyned,
that they were granted vnto
them by the grace and fauour of Our
Predecessours. But as for Our intention
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
herein, God knowes Wee neuer
meant to deny them any lawfull Priuiledges
that euer that House enioyed
in Our Predecessours times, as We expected
Our said Answere should haue
sufficiently cleered them; neither in
Justice what euer they haue vndoubted
right vnto; nor in Grace what euer
Our Predeceßours or We haue graciously
permitted vnto them: And therefore
We made that distinction of</i> the
most part; <i>For whatsoeuer Priuiledges
or Liberties they enioy by any
Law or Statute, shall be euer inuiolably
preserued by Vs; And Wee hope
Our Posteritie will imitate Our footsteps
therein. And whatsoeuer Priuiledges
they enioy by long Custome,
and vncontrolled and lawfull Presidents,
Wee will likewise be as carefull
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
to preserue them, and transmit the
care thereof to Our Posteritie; neither
was it any way in Our minde to
thinke of any particular point wherein
Wee meant to disallow of their Liberties.
So as in Iustice We confesse Our
selues to be bound to maintaine them
in their rights; and in Grace We are
rather minded to encrease, then infringe
any of them, if they shall so deserue
at Our hands. To end therefore
as Wee began, let them goe on
cheerefully in their businesses, reiecting
the curious wrangling of Lawyers
vpon words and syllables; otherwise
(which God forbid) the world
shall see how often and how earnestly
Wee haue pressed them to goe on, according
to their calling, with those
things that are fit to be done for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
weale of Our Crowne and Kingdome;
And how many curious shifts haue
beene from time to time maliciously
found out, to frustrate Vs of Our good
purpose, and hinder them from the
performance of that Seruice, which
they ought to Vs and to Our whole
Kingdome; whereof when the Countrey
shall come to be truely enformed,
they will giue the Authours thereof
little thankes.</i></p>

<p class="drop-capi4">MAster Speaker, <i>Whereas
at the humble suit of
Our house of Commons
Wee condescended to
make this meeting a Seßion before
Christmas, to which purpose We gaue
them time vntill Saturday next, in case
they would seriously applie themselues
to that end; &amp; likewise since, out of Our
Grace, and to take away al mistakings,
by Our Letters directed to Our Secretarie,
Wee were pleased so fully and
clearely to explane Our selues in the
point of maintaining all lawfull Priuiledges
to Our said House, which
since Wee cannot heare hath had the
wished effect, in making them spend
this short time in preparing things
most necessary for a Seßion, Wee haue
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
thought good once more clearely by
this to impart Our minde vnto them;
which is, that in respect of the expectation
after this so long a meeting in
Parliament, as also that the generalitie,
for the most part, rather iudge
things by the outward effects then enter
into the causes of them, Wee haue
an earnest desire to make this a Seßion,
to the end that our good and louing
Subjects may haue some taste, aswell
of Our Grace and goodnesse towards
them by our free Pardon, and good
Lawes to be passed, as they haue had,
both by the great, and vnusuall examples
of Iustice since this meeting, and
the so many eases and comforts giuen
vnto them by Proclamatiō: And therfore
calling to minde, that the paßing
of the Subsidie, an Acte for continuance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of Statutes, and the Pardon, are the
three most preßing businesses to be effected
before the end of the Seßion,
Wee wish them, that, as Wee haue
giuen order for the Pardon to goe
on with all expedition, so they presently
goe in hand with the Acte for continuance
of Statutes. As for the
Subsidie,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span> though time presseth much, yet if
they finde it may not now conueniently be done, we will not make that
any way an impediment to the good which Wee desire our people should
feele by making this a Seßion. Thus much We thought good to giue them
to vnderstand, and withall to assure them, that if they shall not
applie themselues instantly to prepare the aforesaid things for Our
Royall Assent against Saturday next, Wee
will without expecting any further answere
from them, construe by their
slackenesse, that they desire not a Session;
and in such case We must giue a
larger time for their returning homeward,
to such of both Houses as are to
goe into their Countreys to keepe hospitalitie
among their neighbours in this
time of Recesse.</i></p>

Our Grace and good intention towards

spirits, neuer giuing ouer their wicked purpose,
began anew to stirre the coles of
discontentment amongst them; and making
them beleeue, that their Priuiledges
were yet in danger (upon what ground
God knowes, Wee cannot imagine nor
guesse) procured a Committee to be made

violated by Our Letters and messages, and
thereupon in an vnseasonable houre, being
sixe of the clocke at night, and a very thinne
House, scarcely comming to the third part
of the full number, contrary to their owne
custome in all matters of weight, they conclude
and enter a Protestation for their Liberties,
in such ambiguous and generall
words, as might serue for future times to
inuade most of those Rights and Prerogatiues
annexed to Our Imperiall Crowne,
as bee the very markes and Characters of
Monarchie and Souereigntie, and whereof
Wee found Our Crowne vndoubtedly
possessed. For founding the claime of their
Priuiledges vpon the words of Our Writt
for assembling a Parliament, the contriuers
of that Protestation craftily mentioned
some words, <i>viz.</i> <i>Super arduis Regni
negotijs</i>, but of purpose left out <i>quibusdam</i>,

particular Cases, as Wee are to consult with

beginning of the Parliament declare
vnto them what things these <i>quibusdam</i> are,
wherein hee craueth their aduice and assistance;
And vse is euer the best interpreter
of words in a case of this nature: Vpon
which vnduetifull Protestation Wee were
iustly occasioned to publish Our pleasure
